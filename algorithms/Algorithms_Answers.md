Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

A.) O(n) // single while loop

B.) O(n+10) // not entirely sure here... Lot's of things going on but it seems like the initial loop is O(n) 
    and the others are less than that, so the O(n) should override it, but again, not sure...

C.) O(n) // recursion

Exercise II

A.) I think the best scenario is to start on the middle floor and try to create a worse case O(log n) on average and best 
    case O(1) algorithm scenario. If you can keep cutting the floors in halves then you will quickly get your result, and
    potentially get it right the first time.
